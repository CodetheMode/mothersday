      <h3>Since December of 2018, life has been a rollercoaster. Finding out we were becoming parents,
          becoming parents, being parents, it has all been a whirlwind. I did not know what fatherhood would like.
          Now that we have been in the trenches these 8 months, I believe I have never been happier in my life than right now.
          I love seeing and holding you and our boy Big O' every morning and evening. No matter how my day is I know I get to see my family at the end of it.
          I am thankful that God has gifted me you two in my life</h3>
        <h3>In this short time, you have become a wonderful mother. Your joy at Odin's accomplishments and your patience with his antics are admirable.
            Hanging around a baby almost 24/7 is a difficult task, but you fulfill that task everyday with happiness and hope.
        </h3>
        <h3>Thank you for your encouragement in my coding endeavors. As you can see by this little project I have a long way to go.
            I do hope it is at least better then that time I asked you to prom in high school. Anyway, I love you very much.
        </h3>
        <h3>Keep up the good work,</h3>
        <h3>Cody Dye</h3>
